This is a list of rules that should be considered when writing music code.

Rests
1. Always put rests right after notes. When putting multiple rests, the limit being 255, combine them as much as possible.
2. If there are multiple rests (wait macros), then turn the volume to $0. If this is not done, the audio blips at the interval.

Tempo
3. 150 BPM is the standard tempo where quarter notes are length 24. These can be divided into by 2 four times and 3 once.
4. When formulating a new tempo, divide 150 by the desired value then multiply that ratio by 24 to get the new quarter note value.
5. There are no measure macros, so measures should be commented in as to make reading easier.

General Rules
6. The Duty macro changes timbre (sound type) while the Env macro changes lengths and dynamics (take this as a grain of salt).
7. Channels are listed in this order: Channel 1, 0, 4 then 6.
	1 and 0 are square: 	Melody and Countermelody
	4 is sawtooth:		Bassline
	6 is noise:		Percussion


Env Macro
8. Env $0 $00 is the default for Channels 1 and 0, which are the only two channels that this macros should be used.
9. The first input for Env tells how much pitches should bleed together.
	The second tells how short the notes should be ($00 is long and $07 is short).
10. The first input can only go up to $7
	The second can be any size, but code takes the [Input AND $07].
11. Don't play shorter notes for this macro as it has staccato built in.

Duty Macro
12. The Duty macro can be used for Channels 1, 0 and 4.
	Channels 1 and 0: Inputs range from $00 to $03.
		$00 and $01: Hard
		$02 and $03: Soft
	Channel 4: Inputs can be anything, but this also affects the volume.
		$0a: Forte	(timbre changes)
		$0e: Mezzoforte	(used by base game)
		$14: Mezzopiano (timbre changes)
		$0f: Piano	(used by base game)

Simultaneous Notes
13. Do NOT place notes to play the same pitch on different channels at the same time.
	It causes the audio to glitch and strains the ears.

Vol Macro
14. This does not affect Channel 4 in any way. Use Duty instead.
	Inputs range from $0 to $f
		$2: Pianissimo
		$4: Piano
		$6: Mezzoforte (use this the most)
		$8: Forte
